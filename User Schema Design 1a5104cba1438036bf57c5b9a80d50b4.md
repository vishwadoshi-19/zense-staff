# User Schema Design

In Firebase Firestore, data is organized into **collections** and **documents**. For your application, we'll create a users collection where each document represents a user. The structure will accommodate different roles: user, provider, staff, and admin, each with specific fields.

### **Collection: `users`**

- **Document ID (`userId`)**: Unique identifier for each user. Firestore auto-generates this ID upon document creation.

```tsx
{
  "name": "John Doe", // User's full name. Type: String. Required.
  "phone": "+919876543210", // User's phone number in E.164 format. Type: String. Required. Should be unique.
  "profilePhoto": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/your-app-id/o/profilePhotos/johndoe.jpg", // URL to the user's profile photo stored in Firebase Storage. Type: String. Optional.
  "location": "Mumbai", // User's city or location. Type: String. Optional.
  "gender": "male", // User's gender. Type: String. Allowed values: "male", "female", "other". Optional.
  "role": "provider", // User's role in the system. Type: String. Allowed values: "user", "provider", "staff", "admin". Required.
  "createdAt": "Timestamp", // Timestamp of when the user was created. Auto-generated. Type: Timestamp. Required.
  "updatedAt": "Timestamp" // Timestamp of the last update to the user's data. Auto-generated. Type: Timestamp. Required.
}

```

**Notes:**

- **`phone`**: Ensure uniqueness to prevent multiple accounts with the same phone number.
- **`profilePhoto`**: Store the image in Firebase Storage and save the URL here.
- **`createdAt`** and **`updatedAt`**: Use Firestore server timestamps to auto-generate these fields.

### **Role-Specific Fields**

Depending on the user's role, additional fields are required. To maintain a clean and efficient database structure, we'll use **subcollections** for role-specific data.

### **1. Subcollection: `providerDetails` (For Providers)**

**Path**: `/users/{userId}/providerDetails/{providerDetailId}`

```tsx
{
  "email": "provider@example.com", // Provider's email for login. Type: String. Required. Should be unique.

## **Subcollection: `staffDetails` (For Staff Members)**

**Path**: `/users/{userId}/staffDetails/{staffDetailId}`

Each staff member has specific attributes pertinent to their role. Storing these details in a subcollection under the `users` collection ensures organized and scalable data management.
